## Setup

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Java and Maven installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anhdd17/DSA_Revison.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd DSA_Revison
    ```

3. **Build the Project**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. **Run Tests**:

    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

## Usage

After building the project, you can start exploring the implementations. Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its respective package.

For example, to use the linked list implementation, you might find it in:
